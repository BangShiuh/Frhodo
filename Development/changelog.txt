# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]
### Added
- New file "option_panel_widgets" to hold primary functions of options panel
- Widget initialization function in option_panel_widgets
- Option to load full sets of data
- Added set loading and solves for post shock conditions
- Added include checkbox and linked it to a variable in experiment.data
- Moving through shocks in set tree is now possible with selecting a full row and
    using up/down arrow
- Implemented copy function in set tree with CTRL+C and right click
- Right click in set tree has an option to include shock number in copy
- joblib: conda install -c anaconda joblib

### Changed
- Seperated tab selection in tables from mech_widget
- Reorganized functions to make sense with the new "option_panel_widgets"
- Moved most initialization to option_panel_widgets
- Mechanism loading now catches INFO:Root: and other stderr outputs
- Updated Raw Signal Plot estimate indices function's statistics to be based on prior
    success rather than initial guess
- Altered load sequence and moved the functions into "readexp"
- Changed raw signal loading to search for a date in line 1 and if found delete
    first 2 numeric values, which are t0 and dt
- Fixed redundant calculations of SIM upon loading an exp
- Altered loading method to accomodate new loading method
- Moved shock setting functions to their own class, this should make expanding this
    to sets easier

### Removed
- Moved legacy optimization initialization to mechoptimize, currently nonfunctioning
- Moved progress bar to misc_widget


## [1.7] - 2019-05-07
### Added
- Started using a changelog

### Changed
- Integration scheme altered to output data from failed simulations
    - Modified scipy 1.2.1 solve_ivp for this purpose
    - If scipy improves solve_ivp, this will need to be updated
- Blinking log on failed simulation now stops blinking upon simulation success
- Mechanism loading has been updated to catch additional errors, 
    particularly when creating a cantera mech from a chemkin mech


### Removed
-
